Used to access the shareable portion of COMMAND.COM, which may have
been moved into the HMA; only the primary COMMAND.COM retains this
portion.
Procedures called from a dispatcher in COMMAND's resident portion;
most assume that the segment address of the resident portion is on
the stack and are thus not of general use.
DR PalmDOS up to DR-DOS 7.03 COMMAND.COM do not support this call..
When loading the default command processor (no SHELL= directive in
CONFIG.SYS), MS-DOS 6.0-6.22 IO.SYS & PC DOS 6.1-2000 IBMBIO.COM
check a signature <a href="rb-4286.htm#Table4099">(see #04099)</a> in the COMMAND.COM file image to test
if it is actually their own shell and has the correct version, before
they will launch it. If the signature is not found, the message
"Invalid COMMAND.COM" will be displayed. This test seems to have
vanished with MS-DOS 7+, as it uses an .EXE style file format..
In addition to this, the MS-DOS/PC DOS COMMAND.COM checks the version
of the underlaying OS to see if it is their own. Hence, the
PC DOS 6.1 (and by SETVER version faking also the PC DOS 7 and 2000)
COMMAND.COM also run on Novell DOS 7 - DR DOS 7.03, which all
identify themselves as DOS API level 6.0 and IBM OEM (not yet tested
as primary shell).  PC DOS 5.0 COMMAND.COM should run on DR PalmDOS
(untested)..
The MS-DOS 7+ COMMAND.COM seems to no longer perform this kind of
version check any more, which can cause a serious deadlock situation
on a multi-boot system with DR-DOS installed, when the MS-DOS 7+
COMMAND.COM is placed in C:\. When IBMBIO.COM attempts to load the
MS-DOS 7+ COMMAND.COM as a primary shell under DR-OpenDOS 7.02 to
DR-DOS 7.03 no error message will be displayed by COMMAND.COM, but
the machine will just hang. To defuse this situation, DR-DOS 7.02+
IBMBIO.COM was changed to still scan for a SHELL= directive in
[D]CONFIG.SYS even in F5-mode. For maximum safety, the MS-DOS 7
COMMAND.COM should be moved from C:\ to C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\
and a DCONFIG.SYS file should be created containing for example
SHELL=C:\DRDOS\COMMAND.COM instead. If a MS-DOS CONFIG.SYS file
exists, it should contain a SHELL=C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\COMMAND.COM
directive. (If no shell can be found at all, DR-DOS IBMBIO.COM would
display a prompt to enter the proper path to COMMAND.COM)..
The DR-OpenDOS 7.02+ COMMAND.COM is designed to also run on 3rd party
operating systems like MS-DOS/PC DOS 3.31+, Windows 9x, and in DOS
boxes of OS/2, Windows NT and 2000, and will for example also take
advantage of long filenames.

<p><b>Notes:</b>
Since DR DOS 6.0+, MS-DOS 7.0+, PTS-DOS, S/DOS, 4DOS/NDOS use an .EXE
style shell file format, this signature is not met by any release of
these shells. DR DOS 3.31-5.0 used a different jump (E8h) at offset
00h..
Older releases of MS-DOS/PC DOS all had a jump (E9h) at offset 00h, but
other values at offset 03h. For reference here is a list of the
values for some of these older shells:
00h for PC DOS 1.10, Olivetti DOS 2.11, MS-DOS 5.0,
Russian MS-DOS 5.0
1Eh for MS-DOS 4.01
BAh for PC DOS 3.10, 3.20, MS-DOS 3.30
