</PRE>
<p><b>Notes:</b>
In DOS v3+, the limit on simultaneously open files may be increased by
allocating memory for a new open file table, filling it with FFh,
copying the first 20 bytes from the default table, and adjusting the
pointer and count at 34h and 32h.  However, DOS will only copy the
first 20 file handles into a child PSP (including the one created on
EXEC)..
In an OS/2 DOS box, values of D0h-FEh in the open file table indicate
device drivers.
Network redirectors based on the original MS-Net implementation use
values of 80h-FEh in the open file table to indicate remote files;
Novell NetWare also uses values from FEh down to 80h or one more than
FILES= (whichever is greater) to indicate remote files (except on
OS/2, where is uses CFh down to 80h).
MS-DOS 5.00 incorrectly fills the FCB fields when loading a program
high; the first FCB is empty and the second contains the first
parameter.
Some DOS extenders place protected-mode values in various PSP fields
such as the "parent" field, which can confuse PSP walkers.  Always
check either for the CDh 20h signature or that the suspected PSP is
at the beginning of a memory block which owns itself (the preceding
paragraph should be a valid MCB with "owner" the same as the
suspected PSP)..
Novell NetWare updates the fields at offsets 3Eh and 3Fh without
checking that a legal PSP segment is current; see AH=50h for further
discussion.
For 4DOS and Windows95, the command tail may be more than 126
characters; in that case, the length byte will be set to 7Fh (with
an 0Dh in the  127th position at offset FFh), and the first 126
characters will be stored in the PSP, with the entire command line
in the environment variable CMDLINE; under at least some versions
of 4DOS, the byte at offset FFh is *not* set to 0Dh, so there is no
terminating carriage return in the PSP's command tail.
<p><b>BUG:</b>
When shelling out from the Borland Pascal 7.00 IDE, overly-long
command lines will not be delimited by a 0Dh character, and the
length byte is set to 80h!  A workaround is to always patch in a
0Dh at the last position of the command line buffer before scanning
the command line.
