<p>
Please read the file INTERRUP.1ST before asking me any questions.  You may find
that they have already been addressed.

<p><b>FIDO:</b><br>Ralf Brown 1:129/26.1.
Or post a message to me in the DR_DEBUG echo (I probably won't see it.
Unless you address it to me)
<p>
I reply to all e-mail submissions, but some of my replies bounce because of
bad return paths.  If you don't get a response from me within a reasonable
period of time, send it again with a better return path (many mailers are
<p><b>improperly configured and do not produce a valid From:</b><br>Address).
See INTERRUP.1ST for the key to system abbreviations and a list of the
trademarks mentioned here.
<p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b><br>THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED "AS IS".  I verify the information
contained in this list to the best of my ability, but I cannot be held
responsible for any problems caused by use or misuse of the information,
especially for those functions not officially documented.  If it is marked
"internal" or undocumented, you should check it carefully to make sure it
works the same way in your version of the software (and please let me know
whether or not it works the same way).  Information marked with "???" is
known to be incomplete or guesswork.
The use of -> instead of = signifies that the indicated register or register
pair contains a pointer to the specified item, rather than the item itself.
Register pairs (such as AX:BX) indicate that the item is split across the
registers, with the high-order half in the first register.
<p>
One or more letters may follow the interrupt number; they have the following
<p><b>meanings:</b><br>U - undocumented function, u - partially documented function,
P - available only in protected mode, R - available only in real or V86 mode,
C - callout or callback (usually hooked rather than called),
O - obsolete (no longer present in current versions)
The ninth column of the divider line preceding an entry usually contains a
classification code (the entry has not been classified if that character is
a dash).  The codes currently in use are:.
A - applications, a - access software (screen readers, etc),.
B - BIOS, b - vendor-specific BIOS extensions,.
C - CPU-generated, c - caches/spoolers,.
D - DOS kernel, d - disk I/O enhancements,.
E - DOS extenders, e - electronic mail, F - FAX,.
F - file manipulation, G - debuggers/debugging tools, g - games,.
H - hardware, h - vendor-specific hardware,.
I - IBM workstation/terminal emulators, i - system info/monitoring,.
J - Japanese, j - joke programs,.
K - keyboard enhancers, k - file/disk compression,.
L - shells/command interpreters,.
M - mouse/pointing device, m - memory management,.
N - network, n - non-traditional input devices,.
O - other operating systems,.
P - printer enhancements, p - power management,.
Q - DESQview/TopView and Quarterdeck programs,.
R - remote control/file access, r - runtime support,.
S - serial I/O, s - sound/speech,.
T - DOS-based task switchers/multitaskers, t - TSR libraries.
U - resident utilities, u - emulators,.
V - video, v - virus/antivirus,.
W - MS Windows,.
X - expansion bus BIOSes, x - non-volatile config storage.
Y - security, * - reserved (and not otherwise classified)
INT 00 C - CPU-generated - DIVIDE ERROR
</PRE>
<p><b>Desc:</b>
Generated if the divisor of a DIV or IDIV instruction is zero or the
quotient overflows the result register; DX and AX will be unchanged.
<p><b>Notes:</b>
On an 8086/8088, the return address points to the following instruction.
On an 80286+, the return address points to the divide instruction.
An 8086/8088 will generate this interrupt if the result of a division
is 80h (byte) or 8000h (word)
